## Description

This is a front page site for a local custom cake and sweets bakery in North Austin/Pflugerville, Texas. This website is built using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io/). The parallax scrolling effect above and below the main content section was created using the [react-parallax npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-parallax). The form functionality is thanks to the [Formspree](https://formspree.io/f/xbjqovab) service. The website is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and is styled using Google's [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) framework.
